Snake Game
==========
A simple Snake game built in Java, demonstrating a multi-threaded game loop,
keyboard & mouse input, and 2D rendering. Inspired by Google's game of the same
name.

Playing
-------
1. Compile
   - Use your preferred IDE or command-line tools (e.g., `javac`) to compile
     all `.java` files under `src/`.
   - Or simply open the project in an IDE (e.g., IntelliJ) and let it handle
     compilation automatically.

2. Run
   - From the `src` directory (once compiled), run:
     java Main.Main
   - The game window should appear, showing the main menu.
   - Click the Play button (the settings button is not implemented)

3. Gameplay
   - Snake Controls: Move using the W, A, S, D keys.
   - Objective: Eat apples and grow your snake without colliding into
     walls or yourself.

Goals
-----
1. Demonstrate a simple game loop using Java threads (Runnable).
2. Provide keyboard/mouse input handling via listener classes (Key, Mouse).
3. Organize code into logical packages for game objects, states, and UI.
4. Showcase 2D drawing in a Swing JPanel.

Project Layout
--------------

res/ textures
src/
- Buttons/
  - Button, MenuInterface: Handling of UI buttons and interactions.

- GameObject/
  - Apple, EntityType, Snake, SnakeBody, SnakeHead, SnakeTail:
    All snake-related classes and the apple game object.

- GameStates/
  - GameState, MenuState, StateMethods:
    Enums and interfaces for handling different game states (e.g., Menu vs. Play).

- Main/
  - Game, GamePanel, GameWindow, Main:
    Core classes to initialize and run the game loop, manage the main window, and launch the program.

- UserInput/
  - Key, Mouse:
    Listener classes for keyboard and mouse events.

- Utilz/
  - Constants, Images:
    Utility classes for shared constants and image loading.

Work Distribution
-----------------

Caedy: multithreading, menu panel, user input, game states, textures

Oliver: game object manipulation/logic, object rendering, game panel

Known Issues
------------
1. The settings button in the menu is not implemented
2. There is no window after the game closes, which should include the
   user's high score and a way to replay the game.
3. Sometimes the apple spawns inside the snake, but we are unable to find
   the cause in this implementation.

Enjoy our Snake Game!
